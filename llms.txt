Project Overview

Building a customizable scrapbook gallery app for an Arweave hackathon that combines permanent photo storage with creative layout customization (like Instagram meets traditional scrapbooking).
Core Vision

    Full-screen immersive gallery with infinite scroll

    Customizable scrapbook layouts with decorative elements (flowers, stickers, text)

    Permanent storage on Arweave - photos automatically uploaded to blockchain

    Template-based approach for quick styling + custom layout builder for advanced users

UI/UX Design Decisions

    Full-screen canvas for gallery display

    Floating menu button (top-left corner) with dropdown menu (NOT sidebar)

    Dropdown contains: Themes (horizontal scroll), Gallery Direction toggle, basic navigation

    Themes section: Pre-made themes + User's custom themes + Create new button

    Simplified menu options: Upload, Themes, Customize, Album, Favourites, Bin, Export, Share

Key Features Needed

    Photo upload with Arweave integration

    Theme application - transform gallery layout based on selected theme

    Infinite scroll with repeating layout patterns

    Customization page (separate route for advanced editing)

    Gallery management (Album, Favourites, Bin functionality)

Important Notes

    Hackathon timeline - need working demo ASAP, focus on core features first

    Layout patterns - themes should define repeating units that scale infinitely

    Arweave integration - photos auto-upload to permanent storage
